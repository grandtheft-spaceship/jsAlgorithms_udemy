# Learning Algorithms in JavaScript From Scratch
## Introduction to Algorithms & Course Layout

* In this course, we will learn:
  * **Purpose** of each algorithm and what functionality it accomplishes
  * **How** each algorithm is written out in code and **why** it is built the way it is
  * **Concept, skills,** and **techniques** that you can apply to your own code when building applications and programs
* Some of the skills we will learn are:
  * recursion
  * memoization
  * functional programming
* We will be able to apply these skills and techniques to your own programming, and build your own algorithms

### Fizz Buzz

* Common interview question because it shows that that you are a good problem-solver and that you have a solid grasp on the fundamental, JavaScript concepts
* `fizzBuzz(num)` - function that takes any number as an argument (num) and log out every number from 1..num
  * For each number, if that number is divisible by 3, log `Fizz` instead of the number
  * For each number, if that number is divisible by 5, log `Buzz` instead of the number
  * For each number, if that number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log `FizzBuzz` instead of the numbers

### Modulus Operator

* `%` returns remainder of number after number has been divided by another number
